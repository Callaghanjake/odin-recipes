<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This dish is really simple to make because the oven does all of the heavy lifting</p>
<p>While your oven is preheating to 200 degrees celsius, take your oven proof dish and place your block of Boursin soft cheese in the middle.
    Pour your cherry tomatoes around the cheese. Add some mixed herbs and that is now ready to go.
    Next, measure out as much pasta as you would like. This needs to be cooked during the last 10 minutes of the overall cooking time to ensure 
    everything is ready at the same time. Put the oven proof dish in the oven for 20 minutes. Once everything has been cooked, drain your pasta, 
    mix the cheesy, tomato'y dish so you have a cheesy sauce. Stir your pasta in and dish up!
